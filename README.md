# BAR-Widgets
A collection of tweaks for Beyond All Reason RTS

## How to install
Select a widget from `./dist` and download its folder into your `[...]\Beyond-All-Reason\data\LuaUI\Widgets\` folder. You can also automate the download/update process with a batch script. The example can be found at the root of this repository.

If you have downloaded the widget while the game was already running, type `/luaui reload` in the in-game chat to reload all widgets. Then, open the settings menu and enable the widget in "Custom" tab.

## How to build
Run `scripts/build.bat` if you're on Windows or `scripts/build.sh` for Linux/MacOS.
