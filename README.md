# BAR-Widgets
A collection of tweaks for Beyond All Reason RTS

## How to install
Select a widget and download its folder into your `[...]\Beyond-All-Reason\data\LuaUI\Widgets\` folder and enable it from the in-game settings menu. Don't forget to check the dependencies!

You can also automate the download/update process with a batch script. The example can be found at the root of this repository.

## How to enable
If you have installed the widget while the game was already running, type `/luaui reload` in the in-game chat to reload all widgets. Then, open the settings menu and enable the widget in "Custom" tab.
